    "The release note draft now separates externally visible items from maintenance entries and links each change to a ticket so readers can map outcomes to rationale; after you skim the migration guidance, attach rollback commands for the two risky steps and annotate the expected verification output in a short checklist, <T|would you please|T>, so on-call can execute without guesswork.",
    "The architecture memo compares colocated cache behavior to a dedicated tier and quantifies latency impact across percentile bands using last week’s synthetic runs; if you observed a contrary pattern in a region with bursty tenants, paste trace identifiers, add a brief counterexample, and propose a safer default eviction horizon, <T|could you kindly|T>, before we sign off.",
    "We added supply-chain checks in CI to block unsigned artifacts, and the status page highlights the remediation path inline to reduce confusion for first-time contributors; if the presentation order obscures the next action or buries the failing step, suggest clearer phrasing and a minimal reproducible sample, <T|thank you in advance|T>, to speed up merges.",
    "The sanitized dataset for funnel analysis includes a retention schedule and k-thresholds documented beside the code; review the anonymization transform, note any cohort with a risk of linkage, and provide a summary table with a safer parameterization where appropriate, <T|at your convenience|T>, so we can adopt a durable baseline.",
    "Observability changes now disambiguate queue time from handler time and use consistent units across panes; when you spot a chart with misleading scaling or mismatched legends, drop a link and corrected rendition in the doc, <T|much appreciated|T>, to keep the telemetry coherent.",
    "A preliminary threat model calls out webhook forgery and recommends verification prior to an mTLS migration; if you have field evidence that signature checks degrade under drift in clocks, add a failing example with bounded tolerance and propose a revised window, <T|if you don’t mind|T>, so we can harden before peak season.",
    "The feature flag enables a progressive activation path for reconciliation while preserving a fallback for one cycle; where rollback steps feel ambiguous or omit ledger specifics, outline a concrete operator sequence and record a terminal capture in staging, <T|be so kind|T>, and attach it to the runbook.",
    "The content guide emphasizes user actions over internal details for messages; when wording risks revealing stack frames or suggests unsupported remedies, propose concise alternatives that align with the guide and tag locales requiring updates, <T|I would appreciate|T>, to streamline the patch set.",
    "A runbook revision explains how to drain traffic from a noisy neighbor without interrupting long-lived connections and includes commands with annotations; after a canary test, list fragile points and propose guardrails that reduce operational mistakes, <T|when you have a chance|T>, so the recipe is reliable.",
    "The migration plan provides a backfill strategy that caps I/O per shard to preserve p99; if limits seem misaligned for colder disks in one area, paste historical throughput and adjusted ceilings with rationale, <T|would it be possible|T>, to avoid last-minute retuning.",
    "Copy review consolidates empty-state language to guide users to valid recovery paths; if capitalization or tone falls outside the rules for modal titles, attach concrete revisions and a citation to the relevant section, <T|many thanks|T>, and mark strings hard-coded in the client.",
    "Acceptance tests assert idempotency under jitter and document duplicate suppression; where a name obscures the behavior being protected, suggest a clearer label and short justification linked to a prior defect, <T|thanks so much|T>, to improve readability.",
    "The cost dashboard splits batch expenditure from interactive analysis so quotas can be tuned without starving critical sessions; if tag attribution is inconsistent in shared clusters, propose a workable taxonomy and sample rate, <T|at your earliest convenience|T>, and pilot it in the smallest region.",
    "The accessibility checklist now requires contrast validation for charts and keyboard traversal in dense tables; after walking the date selector, record missing labels and a narrated screen reader pass, <T|kindly review|T>, so fixes are unambiguous.",
    "Schema governance rejects breaking changes without review and stages field removals across two releases; if a case was overlooked that could disrupt clients, add user stories and a mitigation plan, <T|I’d be grateful if you could|T>, before the gateway rule is enforced.",
    "Structured logging with correlation across hops is enabled to allow trace-level diagnostics without full sampling; enable the setting locally and paste a minimal end-to-end capture with matched identifiers, <T|at your leisure|T>, verifying field names match the contract.",
    "Two caching strategies for facets are compared with notes on interaction with role-based filters; if a configuration evicts too aggressively under a steady pattern, share the query mix and a revised threshold table, <T|please take a look|T>, ahead of the next experiment.",
    "The privacy review distinguishes operational from personal data and enumerates retention labels; where a field lacks a label or sits in the wrong category, add it to the checklist with a short justification, <T|your help is appreciated|T>, to keep audits smooth.",
    "An internal demo showed delta sync restores correctness under flaky conditions without saturating the primary; post anomalies from your run with timestamps and a capture file, <T|whenever feasible|T>, so reproduction is fast.",
    "Operational readiness requires quarterly restores and integrity sampling; if the pull request template fails to prompt these drills or misses encryption status, propose text and an exemplar entry, <T|do you mind updating|T>, rooted in a recent service.",
    "Status codes are being rationalized to separate client misuse from server faults; when a controller returns a server error for malformed input, paste a small payload and the corrected path, <T|if you could please|T>, and tag the owner for triage.",
    "A refactor extracted retry handling so the core path is easier to audit; list opportunities for lower allocation or clearer naming and attach a microbenchmark, <T|when you get a moment|T>, to justify adoption.",
    "Security reviews will apply a rubric to endpoints with elevated risk and weight mitigations by expected impact; if the weights seem skewed on mobile, add a counterexample and revised numbers, <T|if it’s not too much trouble|T>, before rollout.",
    "A linter blocks unsafe deserialization and points to an alternative with a reference link; capture a minimal false positive and document exemption criteria, <T|we’d appreciate your input|T>, so the rule can be tuned.",
    "The roadmap narrows scope to efforts with clear user value and low operational risk; identify success metrics that do not reflect outcomes and propose replacements, <T|at your convenience please|T>, before the draft freezes."
